### About Me

I am a macroeconomist at the Bank of Canada. I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics from Johns Hopkins University. Before, I worked at the International Monetary Fund and The Brookings Institution as a researcher in macroeconomic issues. I graduated from Cornell University with a master's degree and the Renmin University of China with a bachelor's degree in economics.
